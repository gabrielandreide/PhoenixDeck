## 🚀 What is Phoenix Deck?

Phoenix Deck is an **open-source, modular handheld computer** built for students, makers, and ethical hackers. It combines the power of a **Raspberry Pi 5** with a **touchscreen tablet interface** and a **detachable ESP32 hacking module**—all in one portable, hackable device.

Think of it as a **student-friendly cyberdeck**: part tablet, part ethical hacking tool, and 100% open for learning and experimentation.

### In Simple Terms
- 🖥️ **A real tablet** running desktop OSes (Raspberry Pi OS, Kali Linux, Android/LineageOS)
- 🔧 **Modular & hackable** — attach/detach RF sensors, antennas, and IoT modules
- 🌐 **Open-source** — all hardware designs, firmware, and software will be available on GitHub
- 🎓 **Built for education** — hands-on learning for cybersecurity, IoT, embedded systems, and privacy
